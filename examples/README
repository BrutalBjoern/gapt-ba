This folder is the central repository for all example proofs, proof sequences,
formula sequences, etc. Authoritative versions should be here, copies are put
in various resources-directories or other test scripts.

The files in the lib directory are already compiled as part of gapt---they are
included here as well so that you can adapt them for your own examples.
