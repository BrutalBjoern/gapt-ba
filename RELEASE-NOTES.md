# Release notes for GAPT

## Version 2.0

Thanks to everyone who worked on this release, including Sebastian,
Martin, Simon, Stefan and Giselle!

We have been able to make a lot of progress since the 1.10 release in
September, highlights include:

* Refactoring of (most) calculi (LK, resolution mainly)
* Replay-based proof import for TPTP proofs, including a Vampire and E interface
* New cut-intro code that doesn't need interpolation
* sbt console
* Cleaned up prooftool now supports multiple open windows at once
* Brand new CERES implementation
* Tons of bug fixes

... and much more.
